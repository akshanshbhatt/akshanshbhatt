### Hi there 👋

My name is Akshansh \(/əkʂɑːⁿɕ/[^1]\) and I'm a software nerd. I love working on complex problems. I also love open-source, and sometimes I contribute to projects here.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ~some cool project[^2]~ \[procrastinating\]
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about semaphores and mutexes
- 👯 I’m looking for someone to collaborate with me on my cool project[^2]
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with setting up a home NAS server
- 💬 Ask me about electronic music
- 📫 How to reach me: email
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: you and I are 99.9% same genetically speaking

[^1]: it's pronounced like ~d~uck-shawn-sh~awn~ (cut it at second shawn's sh sound)
[^2]: it's not that cool, let's be honest
